Setup of android databindings

Follow the guide on:
http://developer.android.com/tools/data-binding/guide.html

The important parts are:

Android Plugin for Gradle 1.5.0-beta3 or higher is required.

Add the dataBinding element to your build.gradle file in the app module.

android {
    ....
    dataBinding {
        enabled = true
    }
}

Use Android Studio 1.3 or later.

What can we do with Data Bindings?

Bind a long (use "time" in Data.java) to the_view (this is a TextView in main_activity.xml).

Use "StringUtil.format()" to format the text in the_view.

Make the long observable, there are three way to do this supported by the Databinding lib, try
at least two.

Let visibility of the_view depend on a boolean expression using the ternary operator.
the_view should only be visible if the expression "(data.time / 1000) % 3 == 0" is true.

Bind a handler to the onClick tag of the to handle click events. Change some property of the_view
on every click, for example you could rotate the_view a random amount when clicked.

Remove the visibility nonsense we put in the_view earlier. Now make the_view display the value that
corresponds to key "1" in data.map. the_view should now display "dies Lūnae".

Change the key to be data.shortTime. the_view should now display al the values from the data.map.

the_view goes blank after displaying "dies Saturnī", this is due to the data.map not having any
value for the key "7" resulting in a null being passed back. When null is pased back make the_view
display "No value found for the key.". The ?? operator might be handy here.
