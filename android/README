What can we do with databindings?

Bind a String to a TextView. 

Let visibility of a view depend on a boolean using the ternary operator. Use an "<import type="android.view.View"/>" tag for the View class.

Use a util class to format the text is the textview.

Make the String observable, there are three way to do this supported by the Databinding lib, try atleast two.

Bind a handler to a views onClick tag/method to handle click events.
